Push Swap is an algorithmic project aimed at sorting a set of integers using a limited set of operations while minimizing the number of moves.

Allowed Operations:
- swap_a,
- swap_b,
- push_a,
- push_b,
- rotate_a,
- rotate_b,
- reverse_rotate_a,
- reverse_rotate_b.

Stack Structure:
- Stack_a starts with the input numbers.
- Stack_b is initially empty and serves as a temporary workspace.

The goal is to sort stack_a in ascending order with stack_b empty at the end.
