Push Swap is an algorithmic project aimed at sorting a set of integers using a limited set of operations while minimizing the number of moves.

Allowed Operations:
sa, sb, pa, pb, ra, rb, rra, rrb.

Stack Structure:
stack_a starts with the input numbers.
stack_b is initially empty and serves as a temporary workspace.

The goal is to sort stack_a in ascending order with stack_b empty at the end.
